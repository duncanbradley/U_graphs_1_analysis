# Interpretation of Univariate Scatterplots

## Background

In this experiment, 82 partcipants viewed univariate scatterplots, each with three dot clusters. Following each graph, participants moved a marker on a slider to indicate where they perceived the mean for each cluster.

## Data Pre-Processing

The data provided here is presented in the most unprocessed format possible, however some pre-processing has taken place. This is because the two original data files contained Prolific.co ID codes, which should not be shared publicly, according to Prolific.co guidelines. However, I include the script which details how data in these files were anonymised (`replace_participants_IDs.R`). The output from this script (`U_graphs_1_data.csv`) is used throughout the main analysis. 

## Analysis

Script: `analysis_script.R`

This script has three main sections:

- Data wrangling
- Model-building and visualisation
- Supplementary visualisations for report
